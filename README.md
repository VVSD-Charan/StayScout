# StayScout

### StayScout is a website where people can easily find rooms to rent in the area they want. It has a map where you can see where the rooms are located, and you can click on the map to find rooms in specific places. There's also a search box where you can type in a location to find rooms there. If you're a landlord, you can log in and add your rooms for rent. And if you're someone looking for a room, you can rate and leave comments about the rooms you've visited.
